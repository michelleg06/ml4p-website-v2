Take a few minutes to watch the video below.\n\nAfter watching the videos, we have a practical exercise.\n\n\nA key problem in the design of Social Policies is the identification of people in need of social assistance. Social policies usually work with tight budgets and limited fiscal space. To allocate resources efficiently, benefits need to be targeted to those who need them most. Yet, identifying needs isn’t easy and misclassifications can have severe and irreversible effects on people in need.\nThink of a social protection programme that allocates food vouchers to families with children at risk of malnutrition, or a programme that establishes needs-based school grants. What happens when these limited and finite resources are given to people that could do without, and those who need them most are excluded from them?\nIn this block we’ll work with real-world data from the country of Malawi to predict cash-transfer programme beneficiaries: People who live in poverty and need government assistance to make ends meet. The data comes from McBride and Nichol’s (2018) paper Retooling poverty targeting using out-of-sample validation and machine learning.\nDiscussion Points\nThe points below are meant to help you think critically about why we’re about to embark on a machine learning - targeting exercise. \n\n\nWhy is this a prediction policy problem?
