In last year’s (2024) edition of the Machine Learning for Public Policy course, we partnered with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR, for short) Innovation Office to bring you a live policy challenge, with the topic “Artificial Intelligence for Operational Support to the Forcibly Displaced”

For me, beyond the general learnings from the course, it was incredibly enriching to be part of such a multidisciplinary team during the final challenge. The collaboration between people from social sciences and computer science truly mirrored real-world work environments. It pushed us to think outside the box and taught us how to work effectively with individuals from diverse cultures and backgrounds.
